## About EMS - Event Management System

EMS is a powerful event planning and management system that streamlines event organization, service selection, vendor management, and financial tracking.

### **How EMS Works**
The EMS project follows a structured workflow:

1. **Create a Group**
   - Groups act as a collection of related events.
   - Each event must belong to a group.

2. **Add Multiple Events to a Group**
   - Once a group is created, users can add multiple events under it.
   - Each event has details like date, type, budget, and description.

3. **Add Service and Support Products (SSP)**
   - SSPs are services, setups, and products needed for an event.
   - Categories include Furniture, Decor, Stage, Lighting, and more.

4. **Add Vendors**
   - Vendors provide services for the event.
   - Each vendor has a name, service type, contact information, and pricing.

5. **Associate SSPs and Vendors with Events**
   - SSPs and Vendors can be assigned to an event.
   - The system tracks assignments and their details.

6. **Record Payments and Vendor Transactions**
   - Users can log payments for vendors.
   - The system maintains a financial record for each vendorâ€™s services.

7. **Event Creation Flow (Automated Workflow)**
   - A step-by-step event planning tool.
   - Users select SSPs through an interactive slideshow.
   - The system generates a final quotation.
   - A beautifully formatted PowerPoint presentation is created.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several Django apps:

*   **accounts**: Manages user accounts, authentication, and authorization.
*   **core**: Contains the core functionality of the EMS, including event, group, and SSP (Service and Support Product) management.
*   **event_creation**: Handles the event creation workflow.

## Core Django Files

*   **manage.py**: A command-line utility for interacting with the Django project. It provides commands for running the development server, executing database migrations, and more.
*   **ems/settings.py**: Contains the project's settings, such as database configuration, installed apps, middleware, and more.
*   **ems/urls.py**: Defines the project's URL patterns, mapping URLs to views.
*   **ems/wsgi.py**: A WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) entry point for deploying the project to a production web server.
*   **ems/asgi.py**: An ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) entry point for deploying the project with asynchronous capabilities.
